# Shapes

Shapes is a simple e-commerce theme for [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) and [Snipcart](https://snipcart.com/). Best used for small shops with limited inventory.

## Getting Started

__You'll need a [Snipcart](https://snipcart.com/) account to use this theme.__ All the development is set up to support adding items to your cart from either the homepage or product page, so you'll simply need to add your Snipcart API to the _config.yml file and create your products.
